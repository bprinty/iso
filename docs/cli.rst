============


Once iso is installed, all interaction takes place from the entry point ``iso``:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ iso -h


You can also reference the entry point using the ``python -m iso`` syntax. There are several subcommands you can use with iso, all of which are explained in detail below.


.. Note:: If you are developing within iso and would like to test out any of the entry points, you can access the entry point without installing the repository by:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/iso
        python -m iso -h
